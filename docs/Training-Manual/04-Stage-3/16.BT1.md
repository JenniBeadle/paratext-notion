title: 16. BT1 – Draft a Back Translation


**Introduction**
In preparing for a consultant check, the consultant will need one or more versions of your text in a language they understand. This is often called a back-translation. There are two types of back translations. This module explains how to do a free back-translation and keep it up to date. The next module explains how to do a word-for-word back-translation using the project interlinearizer.


**Where we are**
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.


**Why is this important?**
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.


It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.


**What will you do?**

- Open your project and back translation project
- Arrange your text on the screen.
- Draft your back translation
- Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
- Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.
