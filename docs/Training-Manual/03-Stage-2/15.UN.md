title: 15. UN - Using Notes


**Introduction**
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 9 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.


**Where we are**
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.


:::caution


Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament. :::


**What you are going to do**
You will:

- add more note types (administrator only)
- create notes in the text using different icons,
- open, edit, and resolve notes
- open a notes list
- filter the list
- print a list of the notes

### 15.1 Different types of project notes


You can choose from many different icons for your project notes in Paratext 9:
