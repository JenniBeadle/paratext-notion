## -- title: What is a back translation? (3.2a)


### What is a back translation? What Makes a Good One?


![](./1644901523.png)


A back translation is a way to check a translation. In Bible translation, the vernacular text is translated into a major language so that a translation consultant who is not fluent in the vernacular can examine the translation and help the team improve it. In Paratext, a back translation is done in a separate but linked project.


### What are the qualities of a good back translation?

- Done by someone not involved in drafting the vernacular translation.
- Natural, and reflect how the back translator understands the sense of the vernacular text.
- Without using any helps or other Bibles.
- Reflect what the vernacular text says and not what it should say.
