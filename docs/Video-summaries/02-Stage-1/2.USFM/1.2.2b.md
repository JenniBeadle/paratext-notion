## -- title: How to work with USFMs in Formatted View (1.2.2b)


In this video we changed to Formatted view and learnt about adding and removing USFM styles here.


The view options are available on the menu for the project.

- Click the **≡** menu icon on the project’s title bar.
- Expand the menu if necessary ˅.
	- _The option with the checkmark or tick is the currently selected view_.
- Click **Formatted**.
	- _The view changes and the USFM tags are hidden_.

### Entering character markers

- Press \ backslash
	- _The character marker menu just as in Standard view_.

### Entering paragraph breaks

- Press **ENTER**
	- _A new_ _**normal paragraph**_ _is inserted_.

### Using style chooser on the toolbar


In both Standard and Formatted views the marker which applies to the text is shown in the Style chooser on the toolbar.

- Select the text
- Click the chooser.
	- _The most commonly occurring markers are shown at the top_.
- Select a marker

> If you select a paragraph style, it will be applied to the entire paragraph. If you select a character style will be applied to the selected text.


### Removing an unwanted character style

- Select the text
- On the Style chooser select **Clear formatting**.
	- _The text goes back to normal and behind the scenes the USFM tags have been removed_.
